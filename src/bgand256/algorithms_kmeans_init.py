"""K-means++ initialization algorithm for optimal initial color selection.

This module implements a color selection algorithm based on the k-means++
initialization strategy, which provides a theoretically optimal way to select
initial cluster centers (colors) that are well-distributed in the color space.

The k-means++ approach offers several advantages:
1. Guaranteed O(log k) approximation to optimal k-means clustering
2. Colors are selected to maximize coverage of the color space
3. Probabilistic selection ensures diversity
4. Better initial distribution than greedy selection

Algorithm Overview:
    1. Select first color uniformly at random
    2. For each subsequent color:
       - Calculate squared distances to nearest selected color
       - Select next color with probability proportional to squared distance
    3. Continue until target count reached

Complexity:
    - Time: O(n × t) where n = candidates, t = target colors
    - Space: O(n) for distance tracking
    - Better constants than greedy due to no repeated min calculations

Performance Characteristics:
    - Best for: Initial color selection, diverse palettes
    - Advantages: Theoretically optimal spread, fast selection
    - Limitations: May not maximize minimum pairwise distance
