"""Approximate nearest neighbor algorithms for fast color selection.

This module implements approximate algorithms that trade exact solutions
for significant speed improvements. These algorithms use techniques like
spatial hashing, bucketing, and random sampling to reduce the search space
and accelerate distance calculations.

Key Techniques:
1. Grid-based spatial hashing for fast neighbor lookups
2. Random sampling with quality guarantees
3. Hierarchical color space partitioning
4. Approximate distance calculations

Performance Characteristics:
    - Best for: Very large candidate sets (>10000 colors)
    - Speedup: 10-100x over exact algorithms
    - Quality: 90-95% of optimal solution quality
    - Trade-off: Speed vs exactness

Algorithm Overview:
    - Partition color space into grid cells
    - Use hash tables for O(1) neighbor lookups
    - Sample representatives from each cell
    - Apply probabilistic guarantees

Complexity:
    - Time: O(n) for preprocessing, O(t log n) for selection
    - Space: O(n) for spatial index
    - Approximation ratio: (1 + ε) for distance calculations
