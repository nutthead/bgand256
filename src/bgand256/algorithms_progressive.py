"""Progressive refinement algorithm for iterative color selection improvement.

This module implements a progressive refinement approach that starts with
a coarse selection and iteratively improves it. The algorithm balances
speed and quality by using fast approximations initially and refining
the selection in subsequent iterations.

Key Features:
1. Multi-resolution color selection
2. Iterative quality improvement
3. Early stopping based on quality metrics
4. Adaptive refinement based on time budget

Algorithm Overview:
    1. Start with coarse grid sampling
    2. Iteratively refine by:
       - Adding colors in underrepresented regions
       - Replacing poorly positioned colors
       - Local optimization around selected colors
    3. Stop when quality threshold or time limit reached

Performance Characteristics:
    - Best for: Interactive applications with time constraints
    - Quality: Progressively improves with more iterations
    - Flexibility: Can be interrupted at any time
    - Trade-off: Time vs quality (user-controlled)

Complexity:
    - Time: O(n Ã— i) where i = iterations (user-controlled)
    - Space: O(n) for candidate tracking
    - Quality: Monotonically improving with iterations
