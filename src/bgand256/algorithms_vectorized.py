"""Vectorized color selection algorithm using NumPy batch operations.

This module implements an optimized color selection algorithm that leverages
NumPy's vectorized operations to perform batch calculations, significantly
reducing the computational overhead of iterative distance calculations.

The vectorized approach offers several advantages:
1. Batch color space conversions using NumPy arrays
2. Efficient distance matrix calculations using broadcasting
3. Vectorized minimum distance updates
4. Reduced Python loop overhead

Algorithm Complexity:
    - Time: O(n²) for distance matrix computation, O(n × t) for selection
    - Space: O(n × t) for storing distances to selected colors
    - Where n = number of candidates, t = target count

Performance Characteristics:
    - Best for: Medium-sized candidate sets (1000-10000 colors)
    - Advantages: Efficient use of NumPy/BLAS operations, cache-friendly
    - Limitations: Memory usage scales with n × t
