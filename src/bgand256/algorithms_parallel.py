"""Parallel processing algorithm for color selection using multiprocessing.

This module implements a parallel version of the color selection algorithm
that leverages multiple CPU cores to accelerate distance calculations.
The parallel approach is particularly effective for large candidate sets
and computationally expensive distance metrics like Delta E 2000.

Key Features:
1. Parallel distance matrix computation using process pools
2. Chunked processing to balance load across cores
3. Shared memory optimization for large arrays
4. Automatic core detection and work distribution

Performance Characteristics:
    - Best for: Large candidate sets (>5000) with expensive metrics
    - Speedup: Near-linear with CPU cores for distance calculations
    - Overhead: Process creation and IPC communication
    - Memory: Higher due to process duplication

Algorithm Overview:
    1. Divide distance calculations into chunks
    2. Distribute chunks across worker processes
    3. Merge results and perform selection serially
    4. Optional parallel candidate generation

Complexity:
    - Time: O(n²/p) for distance calculation, where p = processes
    - Space: O(n²) for distance matrix plus process overhead
    - Communication: O(n²) for result aggregation
